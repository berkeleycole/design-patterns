# design-patterns
A coding journey through the (old) but useful headfirst design patterns book 

#### From the O'Reilly book: 
## Head First - Design Patterns
Eric Freeman and Elisabeth Freeman

### Repo Purpose

To follow examples in the book (examples given in Java) and mirror them in other languages for practice while exploring the concepts. Each pattern will be its own folder, each example its own file.
